# Gaming-College-Rankings

## Summary

The goal of this project was to use supervised machine learning on a college ranking dataset to identify whether some metrics have an outside influence on the overall ranks. Put another way: if we were a college president with money to invest and had the goal of improving our college's ranking, which metrics would offer the best ROI? 

The dataset used was the Fall 2022 Washington Monthly rankings data. The Washington Monthly data <a href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2022-college-guide/national/">can be found here</a> and is included in the Resources folder of this repository.

This project was presented during 2U's September 2022 Demo Day event. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sIsP8V9POlaAX15FoTc-cSyBhuIiCIckmcTLBudotPE/edit?usp=sharing">slide deck can be found here</a>.
