All previous iterations have used the Washington Monthly dataset, with the Washington Monthly ranks as targets and the Washington Monthly features as features. This iteration tests the predictiveness of the Washington Monthly features on the US News rankings. Therefore the US News rankings are added in as a target for this iteration. "
